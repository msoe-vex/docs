Raider Robotics Documentation
=============================

Welcome to the documentation site for the Milwaukee School of Engineering's VEX U Team, Raider Robotics!

This documentation site has been constructed to provide a pathway for new and returning students to get their local environments set up properly, and to provide
documentation to previous and upcoming projects performed by the team. This documentation acts in parallel to our yearly Engineering Notebooks, and other internal
documentation produced and shared on our SharePoint website. All of these resources are linked in the documentation directory.
