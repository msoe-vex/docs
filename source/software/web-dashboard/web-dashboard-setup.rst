Setup
=====

The Web Dashboard uses Node.js (aka npm) to manage packages and dependencies.
If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it here: `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_

After installing Node.js, you should clone the web-dashboard repository from msoe-vex/web-dashboard.
    .. Clone msoe-vex/web-dashboard

By default, web-dashboard will contain the files on the default branch of the ``web-dashboard`` repository. The default branch is currently the react rewrite branch ``react-rewrite``.
To launch a copy of the website on your local machine:
   1. Run the command ``npm install`` to automatically install all dependencies.

   .. note::
        You may need to restart VS Code after installing Node.js.

   2. Run the command ``npm start`` to launch the locally built version of the ``web-dashboard`` in your default web browser.
