.. Document outlining the process of developing software on our team

Development Process
===================

.. toctree::
    process-overview

Our team has adapted a custom *development process* to help us design and implement high quality, functional software. This process introduces some additional work to our process, but the benefits vastly outweigh the estra work that is required.

This guide will outline the steps that we take within our process, where to find the resources, and explain why we do them.

The core of this process is the **Software Project Manager**. This is an elected role, which is responsible for managing both the plan for *what work needs to be done*, as well as *how the work is completed*. While still being a very technical role, this position is dedicated to helping others develop high quality software while also working with the executive board to build out features to support the plan for the future of our platform. This role is pivotal to Software Engineering, and this experience is very valuable for any software related internships and jobs.

If you have any questions on this process, or want more information, please talk to the team's *Software Project Manager* and they will assist you.
