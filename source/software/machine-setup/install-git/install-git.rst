Install Git
==============

Git is essential to our software development. Since we work in a large team, we need to find ways to have people both *concurrently* and *collaboratively* develop code, allowing multiple people to work on problems together and independently if needed. If you are new to software, and want to learn more about Git, we highly recommend you read this article `about the basics of Git and why it should be used`__.

Git *can* and *should* be installed on any systems you want to develop code on. This will likely include **both** your Linux VM and your Windows environment, as there is a chance for you to work on code in both environments.

We will walk through the basic steps of installing Git on both systems here. Follow along with the corresponding guide(s) for the installs you want.
