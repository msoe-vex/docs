Software Setup
==============

GitHub
------
Our team uses GitHub to coordinate code development among team members.

    1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one here: https://github.com/signup

    2. Make a post in in the #controls channel in our discord asking for access. Include your GitHub username, full name, or email, and someone on the team will add you to the Raider Robotics team on GitHub.

VS Code
-------
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is our recommend IDE for working on software. It is very flexible and extensible, and has many useful add-ons and extensions.

.. important::
    Visual Studio Code should not be confused with Visual Studio, another IDE created by Microsoft which is intended solely for enterprise developers.

After installing VS Code, sign in to your GitHub account in VS Code by clicking on the account icon in the bottom left hand corner.

To learn how to open and run a specific Raider Robotics project, see that project's page.
