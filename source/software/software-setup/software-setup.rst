Software Setup
==============

GitHub
------
Our team uses GitHub to coordinate code development among team members.

    1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one here: `GitHub Signup <github.com/signup>`_

    2. Make a post in in the #controls channel in our discord asking for access. Include your GitHub username, full name, or email, and someone on the team will add you to the Raider Robotics team on GitHub.

VS Code
-------
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is our recommend IDE for working on software.

.. tip::
    Visual Studio Code is our recommended IDE for new users. You are free to use whatever IDE you prefer.

If you don't have Visual Studio Code already, you can download it here: `Visual Studio Code <code.visualstudio.com/download>`_

.. important::
    Visual Studio Code should not be confused with Visual Studio, another IDE created by Microsoft which is intended solely for enterprise developers.

After installing VS Code, sign in to your GitHub account in VS Code by clicking on the account icon in the bottom left hand corner.

Git
---
Git is a Command Line Interface (CLI) for working with GitHub from the command line.

You can find instructions for installing git by clicking on Source Control in Visual Studio Code (located in the left panel, or by pressing ``Ctrl+Shift+G``).

Git is merely an alternative to using Source Control. Many of the actions git provides can also be done via the Source Control menu in VS Code.

File Management
---------------
We recommend creating a single folder named ``raider-robotics`` containing all of your local raider robotics code.
You can then clone the repositories of the projects you're planning on working on into this folder. 

See the pages of specific Raider Robotics projects to learn how to do this.
