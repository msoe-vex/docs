Getting Started
===============

Our team uses several platforms to work and communicate. The primary resources are as follows:


**Slack** (|https://slack.msoevex.com|)

.. |https://slack.msoevex.com| raw:: html

    <a href="https://slack.msoevex.com" target="_blank">https://slack.msoevex.com</a>

Slack is currently used as our primary means of team communication. This slack channel is combined with the larger :term:`MSOE Robotics` slack, and our channels can be found with the 'vexu-' preface. Slack is open to anyone with a '@msoe.edu' email address, and others can request access to be approved. 

*New for 2021-2022*: We are looking to transfer over to Teams for communication. We will update the team if/when the conversion happens.


**GitHub** (|https://github.com/|)

.. |https://github.com/| raw:: html

    <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a>

GitHub is used for all software projects. GitHub allows us to integrate our project management into our software projects, while also adding source control to our work. The software backlog can be found as a team project board (LINK HERE), which contains prioritized tasks for all current work on the team. To join the GitHub team, request access in the software channel in Slack and we will send an invitation to you.


**OnShape** (|https://onshape.com/|)

    <a href="https://onshape.com/" target="_blank">https://onshape.com/</a>

OnShape is used for all design/CAD projects. OnShape provides a collaborative environment to work on CAD projects, as well as integrating source control into the design process. All documents within the OnShape team should be owned by the team email; if you want a new document created, please create it and transfer ownership to the team account (accounts@msoevex.com) so we can handle document organization. To join the OnShape team, request access in the design channel in Slack and we will send an invitation to you.


**SharePoint** (|https://sharepoint.msoevex.com|)

    <a href="https://sharepoint.msoevex.com" target="_blank">https://sharepoint.msoevex.com</a>

SharePoint is used as the primary document storage platform for our team. Any generalized documentation (financial, team/organization, media, etc) should be located here. This is automatically shared with everyone at MSOE, and syncs up with the team calendar and email group. Students from other organizations (UT Dallas) may struggle to access resources; we are working to improve this process.


**Overleaf** (|https://overleaf.com|)

.. |https://overleaf.com| raw:: html

    <a href="https://overleaf.com" target="_blank">https://overleaf.com</a>

Overleaf is used to create our Engineering Notebook, providing us a collaborative platform to develop in :term:`LaTeX`. All members of the team are open to contribute to the notebook, and we want everyone to help contribute. To join the Overleaf team, request access in the notebook channel in Slack and we will send an invitation to you.

*New for 2021-2022*: We are exploring the possibility of hosting our own :term:`LaTeX` server with MSOE, utilizing :term:`Docker`. We do not expect this to occur any time soon, however the high usage of :term:`LaTeX` within MSOE research makes this an area of future exploration.


**Documentation** (|https://docs.msoevex.com|)

.. |https://docs.msoevex.com| raw:: html

    <a href="https://docs.msoevex.com" target="_blank">https://docs.msoevex.com</a>

The documentation website is used to record our internal processes, structure, and anything else used by parts of the team. The documentation website is managed on GitHub (LINK HERE), using :term:`Sphinx` and :term:`Restructured Text (RST)` to create the document website. The documentation is open to anyone for contribution, and we are always looking for help!
