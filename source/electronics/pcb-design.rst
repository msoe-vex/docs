Designing a PCB
===============

A :term:`PCB`, or *printed circuit board*, is a custom circuit that has been designed online and etched to create one or more layers of circuitry patterns in a small form factor board. 

Our team traditionally uses :term:`KiCAD` to design our boards, as it has support for most steps of the development process. From generating an electrical schematic to routing traces, KiCAD allows you to develop circuits with relative ease.

More information about the KiCAD software `can be found here`__.
